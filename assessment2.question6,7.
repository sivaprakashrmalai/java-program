 (*because in the main class the construction is created for the subclass: 
 so during execution first the program will go to the main function.
 then next going to the subclass.
 then print the displayResult method of subclass.
 nextline we have to invoke the method of superclass.
 then  will go to the superclass ,then print the statement. finally the program will successfully executed.)
